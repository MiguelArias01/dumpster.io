# dumpster.io

Our MERN stack project will be a pseudo e-commerce site. We will model the UI as close as possible to AirBNB and our group will be using Craigslist free listings as our data source. Instead of buying houses, the site/app will be able to show you local free listings from Craigslist. The site / app will have authentication, database (Craigslist JSON/scraper depending), react, and node. Our main goal is to meet these requirements and have a decent ui / clean ui just like AirBNB. Respectively named Dumpster.io. For MVP would be a functional backend with functional authentication, and professional looking front end.
